# ü©∏ Diabetes Prediction Analysis  
This study delves into the potential correlation between the wealth gap, education level, and diabetes beyond lifestyle habits and health conditions.  

Survey data, consisting of **22 distinct categories**, was collected from **253,680 Americans** through the **BRFSS (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System)**.  
Using **R**, I employed **Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Artificial Neural Networks** to establish predictive models for diabetes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Methodology  

- **üìå Logistic Regression:** Used as a baseline model, identifying the **top 5 most important variables** for diabetes prediction. The variable importance plot clearly shows a steep drop in importance beyond the top 5, justifying the feature selection.  

- **üå≥ Decision Tree:** The initial model misclassified all cases as non-diabetic. However, when refined to use **only the top 5 most important variables**, the model's **performance significantly improved**, achieving a **high AUC score**. This refined approach aligns with the findings from logistic regression.  

- **üß† Artificial Neural Network (ANN):** Attempted classification using both the full dataset and the top variables. However, **the ANN model failed to achieve meaningful classification performance**, leading to its exclusion from further analysis.

## üìà 3. Model Performance  

### ‚úÖ Logistic Regression  
- The logistic regression model identified the **top 5 most significant variables**. 
- The model equation is as follows:  

$$ y = -2.99 + 0.43 \times \text{BMI} + 0.62 \times \text{GenHlth} + 0.80 \times \text{HighBP} + 0.44 \times \text{Age} + 0.59 \times \text{HighChol} $$

### üå≥ Decision Tree  
- Initially, the decision tree model **misclassified all cases as non-diabetic** due to noise from low-importance features.  
- After refining the model to **use only the top 5 most important variables**, classification accuracy **significantly improved**.

### üß† Artificial Neural Network (ANN)  
- Due to the large dataset, a **random sample of 10,000 records** was extracted for ANN modeling.
  
- Two ANN models were tested:  
  1Ô∏è‚É£ **ANN with all variables**  
  2Ô∏è‚É£ **ANN with only the top 5 most important variables**  

#### üìå **Findings**  
- Both models **classified nearly all data as non-diabetic (0)**, making them useless for actual prediction.  
- **Sensitivity was close to 0**, meaning the model completely failed to identify diabetic cases.  
- Despite an **AUC score of 0.83**, the misclassification issue rendered the ANN model ineffective.  

#### üìä **Confusion Matrices**  
| Model | Predicted 0 | Predicted 1 |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **All Variables ANN** | **3442**  | **554**  |
|  | **2**  | **2**  |
| **5 Important Variables ANN** | **3444**  | **556**  |
|  | **0**  | **0**  |

## üèÅ 6. Conclusion  

This study explored the relationship between diabetes and various factors, including physical health indicators and socio-economic conditions.  

### ‚úÖ **Key Findings**  
- **Self-assessed health score** emerged as the **most significant predictor** across all models.  
- **Income showed a strong correlation with self-assessed health score**, suggesting that socioeconomic status plays a major role in perceived health and, consequently, diabetes risk.   

### üèÜ **Best Model: Logistic Regression**  
- **AUC = 0.81**, making it the most reliable predictive model.  
**Decision Tree (AUC = 0.74) performed reasonably well**, but its performance was lower compared to Logistic Regression.  
- **ANN was ineffective**, as it misclassified nearly all cases as non-diabetic.  

### üî• **Final Conclusion**  
Diabetes onset is influenced by a **complex interplay of physical health factors (e.g. self-assessed health score) and socioeconomic conditions (e.g., income)**.  
This finding highlights the importance of **considering both medical and socio-economic determinants** when understanding and addressing diabetes risk.
